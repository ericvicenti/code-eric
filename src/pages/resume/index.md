With the support of a few contractors, Eric built the customer-facing website, customer apps, back-of-house apps, and restaurant server. The truck's on-board computer controlled the industrial automation, following smoothie recipes that were configurable from the cloud. A large animated display showed customers when thier smoothie was being prepared, and what ingredients were added.

Eric designed the user experience for the robot control iPad app, managing the the robot's multi-tasking, order queueing systems, inventory management, food safety, and workflows for loading and cleaning.

The company pivoted in 2021 to become [Hyphen Automation](https://usehyphen.com).

## Open Source (2015 - Present)

Eric led the creation of [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org), a widely-used project in the React Native ecosystem which is now supported by a thiving community. Eric continues to be active in the React and web open source community.
